# drm

I decided to try myself not only in attack, but also in defense, if you can call it that, I tried to write a copyright protection system or DRM is an alpha version and is used for files with the .lua format

# requirement
•python 3.0 latest Version 
•Server or computer
• MySQL (FOR this prog. u can use phpmyadmin for example)

# How To Use
1. Open You phpmyadmin panel 
2. Create New DataBase `gmlua` (for example)
3. Go to import tab and upload file `glua.sql`
4. Run `Server.py` and `create_obfuscate.py`
5. Set a path to file and rejoice

## the script needs to be improved, namely to add an obfuscation system if I'm not too lazy to add, and so whoever wants can use and rewrite:)
